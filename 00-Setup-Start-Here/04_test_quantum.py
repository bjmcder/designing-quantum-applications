"""Build a Bell state and run it on a simulator, then on real IBM hardware.

A guided walkthrough of the modern Qiskit Runtime workflow: named
registers, a named circuit, PUBs, samplers, job submission/retrieval, and
post-processing raw shot data into counts. No plotting here.

The hardware queue can be long, so while waiting this script prints a
status/queue update every few seconds (see --poll-interval). The job ID is
also saved locally as soon as it's submitted -- if this script loses its
connection (or you close your laptop) while waiting, the job keeps running
on IBM's servers regardless; fetch its result later with
05_retrieve_job.py instead of resubmitting.

Run with no arguments. Pass --skip-hardware to run only the simulator step.
