"""Ops: build the Hamiltonian for the traveling salesman example.

The problem: visit every city once and return to the start, as cheaply as
possible. We write it as a QUBO (quadratic unconstrained binary optimization)

    minimize  E(x) = x^T Q x + offset,   x_i in {0, 1}

and convert it to an Ising Hamiltonian with x_i = (1 - Z_i) / 2, so the
ground state of H is the cheapest tour.

Binary variables (see encoding.py): x[c, t] = 1 means city c is at position
t. City 0 is fixed at position 0. A tour is a loop with no natural starting
point, so fixing one city removes rotated copies of the same tour and saves
qubits. Four cities leave 3 x 3 = 9 variables.

The input is a table of travel costs, d[a, b] = cost of going from city a to
city b. The table does not have to be symmetric.
